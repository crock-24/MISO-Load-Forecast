# MisoLoadForecast
To maintain the grid's dependability, precise energy consumption forecasts within the MISO power grid footprint is essential. This study examines the MISO monthly aggregated energy data to determine which model best fits the data observed. The important questions we are interested in addressing include: does the data exhibit a seasonal trend, is there growth in load over time after controlling for seasonality, and what can we anticipate for future load? This study answers these questions by diving into the consumption patterns through the use of statistical tests, model diagnostics, and forecasting techniques.
